      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, in the security world there are a lot of buzz words which
        may seem to relate to the same thing, but in reality can be very
        different depending on who you ask as there are multiple organistations
        that set these definitions.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
      <ul class="two-columns">

      </ul>
      <p>
        All of the terms above are interlinked and the meaning of them depends
        on who you ask as there are multiple organisations which set the
        definitons of these terms. Information Security will usually include the
        non-technical side of security as well, whereas Cybersecurity will not.
        Computer security is essentially Cybersecurity but on a smaller scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        All defintions taken from
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/" target="_blank">NIST</a>
        which is one of main organistations which creates standards, guidelines
        and best practices to manage Cybersecurity/ Information Security risks.
        The other organistation being the
        <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">ISO</a>, hence
        the difference in defintions and best practices amongst other things.

        The reasons, techniques and perpetrators of cyber crime vary massively
        ranging from revenge, financial gain, espionage or simply just for fun
        and are carried out by individuals, organisations and nations with
        varying degrees of damage.

      <h3>Types of Attacks</h3>
      <ol class="two-columns">
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/guidance-topic/phishing"

              <span class="inline-d">What is it -</span> A form of
              <a
                href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/social-engineering-attacks"
                target="_blank"
                >social engineering</a
              >
              where the target is tricked into performing an action which leads
              to a vulnerabilty
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How is it carried out -</span> The attacker
              will usually send out emails or messages which appear to be
              genuine, such as a fake bank statement. This deceitful email will
              then trick the user into entering their bank details which are
              then transferred back to the attacker, allowing them to steal
              funds from the account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How can it be prevented -</span> Being
              aware of phishing attacks and taking care when clicking on links
              in emails/ messages is the best prevention technique here.
              Organisations may also introduce filters into their email system
              which restricts emails coming from outside sources.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            target="_blank"
            >Dos and DDoS</a
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">What is it -</span> DoS and DDoS are both
              acronyms for Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service
              respectively. Usually directed towards organisations and
              governments instead of individuals as a result of ideology instead
              of financial gain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How is it carried out -</span> Both similar
              as they both overload a server with requests, resulting in reduced
              functionallity for that server and potentially shutting it down,
              hence DoS. DDoS attacks come from a network of connected computers
              called botnets whereas DoS attacks originate from one source. DDoS
              attacks are usually more punishing because of this as it can be
              difficult to find the origin and block it from making requests to
              a server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How can it be prevented -</span> By using a
              combination of Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion
              Prevention Systems. These basically just monitor and block any
              unwanted connections by matching patterns between what is actually
              happening and what they have been &ldquo;told&rdquo; what a danger
              is.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">What is it -</span> Generic term for any
              attack involving malicious software. Examples include key-loggers
              which track what you have typed and
              <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/worm" target="_blank"
                >worms</a
              >
              which replicate themselves and infect inter-connected devices as
              opposed to a regular virus which usually only infect one machine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How is it carried out -</span> Usually
              there is an element of social engineering involved such as a
              phishing attack with a seemingly legitimate looking link which
              actually contains a malicious payload. Another way in which this
              is achieved is through
              <a
                href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting"
                >Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a
              >. To achieve this attackers will take advantage of an insecure
              website and sneakily embed the malicious software, which is then
              executed when a user accesses that website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How can it be prevented -</span> Some
              overlap with preventing phishing as social engineering is a key
              part in the delivery of malware so awareness of the way in which
              attackers operate is key. Anti-virus software is also a good idea.
              Some organisations impose restrictions on the devices their
              employees use. This is known as

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">What is it -</span>A way in which an
              attacker &ldquo;cracks&rdquo; a password in order to gain
              unauthorized access to a system.

            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How is it carried out -</span>
              Achieved through a program which normally submits between 10,000
              and 1 billion passwords per second depending on how powerful their
              equipment is. Simple to do and very effective.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="inline-d">How can it be prevented -</span> Using very
              strong passwords i.e. long, not an actual word, and containing a
              mix of numbers, symbols and letters. Another way which prevents
              unauthorized access even if the password is cracked is by using
              two-factor authentication (2FA) so when trying to log into a
              computer/ service the user will also have to enter the new factor
              (usually a randomly generated number).

                  Elfin is an Iranian sponsored APT group. Also known as APT33

                <p>
                  Became famous in 2012 after an attack on Saudi Arabia's state
                  owned oil company,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco">Aramco</a
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this attack over 35,000 windows based machines were
                  infected with the Shamoon virus causing data to be deleted and
                  overwritten, preventing any attempt of recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This resulted in the supply levels of petrol and other crude
                  oil derivatives to reach dangerously low levels due to payment
                  processing issues. Also left Saudi Arabia with no choice but
                  to buy most of the world's available hard drives, further
                  straining the current supply chain issues at the time due to
                  floods in Thailand.

                  Sandworm is another ATP and is a division of the Russian
                  military. Also called Voodoo Bear.

                  In 2015 this group carried out an attack on Ukraine's power
                  grid, causing power outages for ~230,000 people.

                <p>

                  edition of the BlackEnergy malware which in it's early stages
                  would "infect" machines allowing a botnet to be created in
                  order to perform DDoS attacks. The latest edition has a
                  greatly improved functionallity and includes key logging,
                  screenshots, scan networks and the ability to remotely execute
                  programs. The malware is spread through spear-phishing.

                  Stuxnet is a worm developed by the USA to attack Iranian
                  nuclear facilities in order to halt the development of nuclear
                  weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is believe that the worm was introduced to the facility via
                  a random USB and then worms being worms, propagated itself
                  through their networks and then disrupt SCADA and PLC systems
                  used to control centrifuges for the processing of Uranium.
