      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        First of all, in this security world there are a lot of buzz words which
        may seem to relate to the same thing, but in reality can be very
        different depending on who you ask as there are multiple organistations
        that set these definitions.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
      <ul class="two-columns">
        <li>
          Information Security - The protection of information and information
          systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
          modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyber Security - Measures and controls that ensure confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of the information processed and stored by
          a computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computer Security - Prevention of damage to, protection of, and
          restoration of computers, electronic communications systems,
          electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic
          communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its
          availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and
          nonrepudiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of the terms above are interlinked and the meaning of them depends
          on who you ask as there are multiple organisations which set the
          definitons of these terms. Information Security will usually include
          the non-technical side of security as well, whereas Cybersecurity will
          not. Computer security is essentially Cybersecurity but on a smaller
          scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confidentiality - Preserving authorized restrictions on access and
          disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and
          proprietary information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrity - Guarding against improper information modification or
          destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and
          authenticity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Availability - Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-repudiation - A service that is used to provide assurance of the
          integrity and origin of data in such a way that the integrity and
          origin can be verified and validated by a third party as having
          originated from a specific entity
        </li>
        <li>
          All defintions taken from
          <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/">NIST</a> which is one of
          main organistations which creates standards, guidelines and best
          practices to manage Cybersecurity/ Information Security risks. The
          other organistation being the
          <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">ISO</a>, hence the difference
          in defintions and best practices amongst other things.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Boring bit over ...for now.</p>

      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <p>
        <em class="definition">
          <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyber_threat"
            >Threat (NIST)</a
          >
          - Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
          agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or
          reputation), agency assets, or individuals through an information
          system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification
          of information, and/or denial of service.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons, techniques and perpetrators of cyber crime vary massively
        and can range from an individual compromising a digital billboard in
        order to post a funny message to advanced persistent threats from
        nations in order to compromise another nations key infrastructure.
